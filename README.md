A natural language processing model based on tdidf and count vectorize feature extraction and then  creating machine learning model to detect
whether given a tweet in spanish is humourous or not.(Please see Classification IPYNB file for more details and for all the models used).

As for Regression, I used the same features as for classification including the result given from classification model(humour or not humour not) to
predict the funiness rating for a given tweet. Please see Regression IPYNB file for more details and for all the models used).
